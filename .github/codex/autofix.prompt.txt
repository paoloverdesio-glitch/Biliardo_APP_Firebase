You are Codex running inside a GitHub Actions workflow.

GOAL
Make the CI workflow "build" succeed for BOTH targets with 0 errors:
1) dotnet build Biliardo.App/Biliardo.App.csproj -c Debug -f net8.0-windows10.0.19041.0 --no-restore
2) dotnet build Biliardo.App/Biliardo.App.csproj -c Debug -f net8.0-android --no-restore

RULES
- Keep changes minimal and strictly related to fixing build errors.
- Do NOT modify generated outputs under **/bin or **/obj.
- Do NOT add secrets, tokens, credentials, or API keys to the repo.
- Prefer fixing project settings / code over disabling warnings or skipping builds.
- If you need to adjust a workflow, do it only if necessary for the build to run correctly.

OUTPUT
Produce a commit that fixes the build. If there are no changes needed, do nothing.
